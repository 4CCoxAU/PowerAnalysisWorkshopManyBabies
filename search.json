    "text": "Modelling the Simulated Data\nLet’s think about how we want to run a generalised linear mixed-effects model of the data. For a varying intercepts, varying slopes model for each subject, we could run the following model with the lmer syntax as follows:\n\nLT ~ 1 + SpeechStyle + (1 | item_id) + (1 + SpeechStyle | subj_id)\n\nIn this model, LT is the response variable; 1 corresponds to the grand intercept (beta_0); SpeechStyle is the predictor for the ADS/IDS manipulation for item i; (1 | item_id) specifies a by-subject random intercept (O_0i); (1 + SpeechStyle | subj_id) specifies a subject-specific random intercept (T_0s) plus the subject-specific random slope of SpeechStyle (T_1s). The error term (e_si) is automatically included in all models, so is left implicit.\nThe terms in parentheses with the “pipe” separator (|) define the random effects structure. For each of these bracketed terms, the left-hand side of the pipe names the effects you wish to allow to vary and the right hand side names the variable identifying the levels of the random factor over which the terms vary (e.g., subjects or items). The first term, (1 | item_id) allows the intercept (1) to vary over the random factor of items (item_id). This is an instruction to estimate the parameter underlying the O_0i values, namely omega_0. The second term, (1 + X_i | subj_id), allows both the intercept and the effect of category (coded by X_i) to vary over the random factor of subjects (subj_id). It is an instruction to estimate the three parameters that underlie the T_0s and T_1s values, namely tau_0, tau_1, and rho.\nGiven that looking time data tends to be right-skewed, we can model the data using a logarithmic link function to take this into account. The GLMM would look as follows. We will use the summary() function to view the results.\n\ndataSimulated &lt;- SimulateLTData()\n\nmodel &lt;- glmer(LT ~ 1 + SpeechStyle + (1 | item_id) + (1 + SpeechStyle |\n    subj_id), data = dataSimulated, family = Gamma(link = \"log\"))\n\nsummary(model)\n\nGeneralized linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood (Laplace\n  Approximation) [glmerMod]\n Family: Gamma  ( log )\nFormula: LT ~ 1 + SpeechStyle + (1 | item_id) + (1 + SpeechStyle | subj_id)\n   Data: dataSimulated\n\n     AIC      BIC   logLik deviance df.resid \n  7283.2   7310.8  -3634.6   7269.2      377 \n\nScaled residuals: \n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-2.3136 -0.6005 -0.2086  0.4779  5.9609 \n\nRandom effects:\n Groups   Name        Variance Std.Dev.

We turn to this problem in the second exercise sheet, but first, let’s make sure that we’ve understood the principles behind data simulation and power analysis.",

    "text": "Cumulative Science Perspective\nScience stands on the shoulders of – not giants – but normal human beings who are as susceptible to confirmation and selection biases as everyone else. The limitations of relying on single studies have motivated a push towards methods of synthesising quantitative evidence in the form of meta- and mega-analyses (Koile & Cristia, 2021; Liu & Almeida, 2023; Zettersten et al., 2023). To counter selection biases and obtain an objective picture of a given field, there exist detailed procedures restricting researcher degrees of freedom in the process (Moher et al., 2009; Page et al., 2021). Synthesising evidence from studies in a cumulative approach offers insights to the generalisability and heterogeneity of the construct across a wide variety of experimental designs, participants and stimuli (Cristia et al., 2022; Cruz Blandón et al., 2023; Koile & Cristia, 2021; Tsuji et al., 2014). There are limitations to this process of estimation across studies, such as issues in transparency and reproducibility (Lakens et al., 2016, 2017; Nuijten et al., 2020), considerable errors of extraction (Zettersten, Cox, et al., 2023), reliance on published literature and concomitant bias (Moher et al., 2009; Page et al., 2021), as well as substantial between-study heterogeneity threatening practical interpretation of results (Mathur & VanderWeele, 2019). There are statistical approaches that attempt to correct for publication bias and to account for heterogeneity; however, major concerns about the validity of meta-analytic estimates remain (cf., Kvarven et al., 2020). These concerns primarily revolve around the reliability of meta-analytic estimates rather than the synthesis of insights and exploration of the sampling space of individual studies (Mathur & VanderWeele, 2020; Zettersten, Cox, et al., 2023). A related cumulative method that synthesises findings across multiple individual experiments involves multi-lab replication studies. In such designs, multiple labs conduct replications of original studies by implementing a common experimental protocol to test a research question across sites (ManyBabies Consortium, 2020). By varying experimenter identity and increasing sample diversity, these large-scale studies contribute to a greater likelihood of generalisability and precision (Byers-Heinlein et al., 2021; ManyBabies Consortium, 2020). However, the high degree of uniformity in methodological and analytic implementation can lead to less generalisability across other conditions than a meta-analysis.\nIn a recent study (Zettersten, Cox, et al., 2023), we attempted to reconcile the results from a multi-lab replication study (ManyBabies Consortium, 2020) and a community-augmented metaanalysis on infants’ preference to attend to IDS over ADS. The findings from each source individually provided an incomplete picture of moderators of the IDS preference effect; for example, the two studies differed with respect to their findings on the effect of infant age, with a linear increase in the multi-lab replication study and a finding of stability across infant ages in the meta-analysis. As we suggest in the paper, this conflict may originate in factors beyond the underlying construct. Investigators in the meta-analysis had the freedom to tailor their stimuli and methods to the particular infant age investigated, which may in turn mask age-related changes in the strength of the IDS preference effect. In contrast, the speech stimuli in the multi-lab replication study were held uniform across participating laboratories and may have been better suited for children in older age ranges (ManyBabies Consortium, 2020). The synthesis of these results underscores the value of being able to generalise across various populations, experimental methodologies and infant ages, but also highlights the importance of acknowledging the inferential limitations of evidence synthesis methods (Lakens et al., 2017). Seeing scientific advancement as an iterative procedure involving data accumulation and theory development empowers us to map out the diversity of samples in earlier research, scrutinise the possibilities for generalisability, and point to future directions of research (Fusaroli et al., 2022; Zettersten, Cox, et al., 2023).\nIn the lecture, we introduced the importance of a cumulative science perspective on scientific enquiry and argued that our explorations need to reflect the systematic exploration of the methodological space. Heterogeneity here plays a key role in the evidence that we have available to us.\nLet’s imagine a scenario where a synthesis of evidence has produced an effect size estimate of 0.35 [XX; XX], just as in Zettersten, Cox, Bergmann et al. (2024). How can we use this to guide our study of IDS preference?\nLet’s start by taking the simulation function we made in the previous exercise and adapt it to the new scale of effect sizes:\n\n# set up the custom data simulation function\nSimulateEffectSizeData &lt;- function(\n  n_subj = 24,   # number of subjects\n  n_ADS  = 8,   # number of ingroup stimuli\n  n_IDS =  8,   # number of outgroup stimuli\n  beta_0 = 0,   # grand mean\n  beta_1 =  0.35,   # effect of category\n  omega_0 =  0.05,   # by-item random intercept sd\n  tau_0 = 0.1,   # by-subject random intercept sd\n  tau_1 =  0.1,   # by-subject random slope sd\n  rho = 0.4,   # correlation between intercept and slope\n  sigma = 0.5) { # residual (standard deviation)\n\n  items &lt;- data.frame(\n  #item_id = seq_len(n_ADS + n_IDS),\n  Register = rep(c(\"IDS\", \"ADS\"), c(n_ADS, n_IDS)),\n  O_0i = rnorm(n = n_ADS + n_IDS, mean = 0, sd = omega_0)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(item_id = faux::make_id(nrow(.), \"I\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(SpeechStyle = recode(Register, \"ADS\" = -0.5, \"IDS\" = +0.5))\n\n  # simulate a sample of subjects\n\n# sample from a multivariate random distribution \n  subjects &lt;- faux::rnorm_multi(\n  n = n_subj, \n  mu = 0, # means for random effects are always 0\n  sd = c(tau_0, tau_1), # set SDs\n  r = rho, # set correlation, see ?faux::rnorm_multi\n  varnames = c(\"T_0s\", \"T_1s\")\n) %&gt;%\n  mutate(subj_id = faux::make_id(nrow(.), \"S\"))\n\n  ParameterValues &lt;- crossing(subjects, items)  %&gt;%\n    mutate(e_si = rnorm(nrow(.), mean = 0, sd = sigma)) %&gt;%\n    dplyr::select(subj_id, item_id, Register, SpeechStyle, everything())\n  \n  EffectSizeDataSimulated &lt;- ParameterValues %&gt;%\n    mutate(LT = beta_0 + T_0s + O_0i + (beta_1 + T_1s) * SpeechStyle + e_si) %&gt;%\n    dplyr::select(subj_id, item_id, Register, SpeechStyle, LT)\n}\n\nEffectSizeDataSimulated &lt;- SimulateEffectSizeData()\n\nLet’s again plot this data and see if it looks correct:\n\nEffectSizeDataSimulated &lt;- SimulateEffectSizeData()\n\nmeanADSRT &lt;- mean(filter(EffectSizeDataSimulated, Register ==\n    \"ADS\")$LT)\n\nEffectSizeDataSimulated &lt;- EffectSizeDataSimulated %&gt;%\n    mutate(LT = LT - meanADSRT)\n\ndat_sim_plot &lt;- EffectSizeDataSimulated %&gt;%\n    group_by(subj_id, Register) %&gt;%\n    dplyr::summarise(medLT = mean(LT))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'subj_id'.

As we saw in the previous exercise sheet, however, our experimental design choices really matter for statistical power. For example, the number of stimulus items (i.e., number of repeated measures per participant) matter hugely, as does number of participants.

This clarity is important because we need to define the parameters that govern the process we assume can give rise to the data. If we are building on ManyBabies1, then we are dealing with a within-subjects, between-items study; that is, each and every subject receives both ADS and IDS stimuli (within-subject), but each stimulus is either ADS or IDS (between-items).\nBecause infants are not the most patient of participants, perhaps a realistic study design would allow researchers to expose infants to 8 recordings of ADS and 8 recordings of IDS. And let’s say that a realistic sample size our laboratory would be around 25 participants. This implies a total of 400 obsevations in this study (i.e., 8 + 8 recording stimuli for each of the 25 children).

    "text": "Choosing Values for Fixed Effect Parameters\nLet’s start by setting the fixed-effect parameter of SpeechStyle (β₀ + β₁*SpeechStyle). How should we set these parameters? First of all, we can be guided by what we know about looking time distributions in infant experiments. For example, we could imagine average infant looking times to be around 7 seconds (i.e., 7000ms), and from ManyBabies1, we know that infants exhibit around X seconds (i.e., 2000ms) longer looking times to IDS stimuli than to ADS stimuli. Let’s go ahead and code these values explicitly as parameter values in our simulation.\n\n# set fixed effect parameters\nbeta_0 &lt;- 7000  # intercept; i.e., the grand mean, β₀\nbeta_1 &lt;- 2000  # slope; i.e, effect of IDS, β₁\n\nWhen we’re modelling data from experiments involving individuals (like infants in this case), it’s essential to account for the fact that each individual may have a unique baseline reaction to the stimuli, which we can’t anticipate or control for entirely. Similarly, the effect of the stimuli itself might vary across different instances of the stimulus. In other words, we expect variability both in how subjects react and in the impact of each stimulus. To address this, we introduce random intercept values for subjects and items. This means we allow for each subject and each stimulus item to have its own intercept value, capturing their individual baseline reactions and effects. To quantify the variability around these values, we introduce the standard deviation of the random intercepts, reflecting the range of differences we might observe among subjects’ reactions and the effects of different stimulus items. Let’s code this as standard deviation of by-subject random intercept and by-item random intercept sd.",

Some infants might be more responsive to IDS stimuli than others, leading to differences in their looking times. Therefore, we need to introduce subject-specific variability to account for how the effect of IDS varies among infants. In statistical modeling, when we include random slopes, we’re essentially allowing the effect of certain variables to vary not only across different individuals (random intercepts) but also across different levels of another variable (random slopes).\nWhen we introduce random slopes, we need to consider potential correlations between these varying slopes and the varying intercepts. This is because if there’s a correlation between the way individuals (infants, in this case) respond to the IDS stimuli (reflected in the random slopes) and their baseline behaviors (reflected in the random intercepts), it can affect our model’s predictions. For instance, if infants who naturally have longer attention spans (reflected in higher random intercepts) also tend to show stronger responses to IDS stimuli (reflected in steeper random slopes), ignoring this correlation might lead to biased estimates or inaccurate predictions. Including a correlation matrix allows us to explicitly account for these potential correlations, ensuring that our model accurately captures the relationships between different sources of variability in the data and produces more reliable results. To capture these patterns, we include a correlation matrix, specifying a weak correlation between the varying intercepts and varying slopes of infant participants. Lastly, we incorporate a residual error term to account for any unexplained sources of variability in the model. This helps ensure that our model accurately captures the complexities of infants’ responses to different stimuli while also acknowledging inherent variations and correlations within the data.\n\n# set more random effect and error parameters\ntau_1 &lt;- 1000  # by-subject random slope sd\nrho &lt;- 0.2  # correlation between intercept and slope\nsigma &lt;- 500  # residual (error) sd",

    "text": "Simulate the sampling of stimulus items\nNow it’s time to create a dataset that lists, for each stimulus item, the speech style it is in and its varying properties on infants’ looking times. This captures the intuition that we would expect different speech recordings to exhibit variation in infants’ average looking times. Here, we model items only with varying intercepts. To set the parameter for varying item intercept, we are going to specify the standard deviation that we expect items to exhibit in the parameter, item_sd, in the below code. That is, we sample values from a normal distribution using the rnorm() function, with a meaan of 0 and standard deviation of item_sd. For the varying item variable, we also need to assign a unique identifer to each of the 16 speech stimuli and designate whether the stimuli are ADS or IDS, with the first 8 being ADS and the next 8 being IDS. We are going to use the faux package to carry this out. Lastly, we will carry out contrast coding, and we will later multiply this effect-coded factor by the fixed effect of category to simulate data where the ADS stimuli on average generate looking times of -500 ms different from the grand mean, while the IDS stimuli are on average 1000 ms different from the grand mean.\n\n# simulate a sample of items\n# total number of items = n_ADS + n_IDS\nitem_sd &lt;- 200\nitems &lt;- data.frame(\n  #item_id = seq_len(n_ADS + n_IDS),\n  Register = rep(c(\"IDS\", \"ADS\"), c(n_ADS, n_IDS)),\n  O_0i = rnorm(n = n_ADS + n_IDS, mean = 0, sd = item_sd)\n) %&gt;% \n  mutate(item_id = faux::make_id(nrow(.), \"I\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(SpeechStyle = recode(Register, \"ADS\" = -0.5, \"IDS\" = +0.5)) #introduce a numeric predictor to represent what category each stimulus item, we set ADS to be -0.5 and IDS to be +0.5.

    "text": "Simulate the sampling of subjects\nNow, we will simulate the sampling of individual subjects to create a table that lists each subject along with their two correlated varying effects, namely intercepts and slopes. This process is slightly more complex than before because we cannot simply sample the intercept values (𝑇0𝑠) independently from the slope values (𝑇1𝑠) using rnorm(). Instead, we need to sample pairs of ⟨𝑇0𝑠,𝑇1𝑠⟩ values for each subject from a bivariate normal distribution. We will use the rnorm_multi() function from the faux package (DeBruine 2020) to carry this out. This function generates a table of simulated values from a multivariate normal distribution, allowing us to specify the means (mu) and standard deviations (sd) for each variable, along with the correlations (r), which can be a single value applied to all pairs, a correlation matrix, or a vector of values representing the upper right triangle of the correlation matrix.\n\n# simulate a sample of subjects\n# sample from a multivariate random distribution \nsubjects &lt;- faux::rnorm_multi(\n  n = n_subj, \n  mu = 0, # means for random effects are always 0\n  sd = c(tau_0, tau_1), # note that we set the SDs further up in the code when specifying varying intercepts and sloeps.\n  r = rho, # set correlation, see ?faux::rnorm_multi\n  varnames = c(\"T_0s\", \"T_1s\")\n) %&gt;%\n  mutate(subj_id = faux::make_id(nrow(.), \"S\")) # add subject ids that correspond to the number of rows simulated.\n\nAgain, let’s visualise this process, so that we are sure what is going on:\n\nglimpse(subjects)\n\nRows: 25\nColumns: 3\n$ T_0s    &lt;dbl&gt; 884.80961, 1710.55508, 1635.49818, -4947.76450, -390.13885, 83…\n$ T_1s    &lt;dbl&gt; 1165.1005, 1063.9211, 489.8264, 327.8312, 899.7244, 1197.1137,…\n$ subj_id &lt;chr&gt; \"S01\", \"S02\", \"S03\", \"S04\", \"S05\", \"S06\", \"S07\", \"S08\", \"S09\",…\n\nsubjects %&gt;%\n    pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"T\"), names_to = \"T_variable\",\n        values_to = \"value\") %&gt;%\n    ggplot() + geom_density(aes(value, fill = T_variable), alpha = 0.8) +\n    xlim(c(-4 * tau_0, 4 * tau_0)) + facet_wrap(~T_variable) +\n    ggtitle(\"Varying Intercept and Slope Terms for Subjects\") +\n    plot_theme + scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") + theme(axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank())",

This function generates every possible combination of rows from the subject and item tables, ensuring that each subject’s responses to each item are included in the dataset. To introduce variability reflecting the inherent fluctuations in trial-by-trial performance, we incorporate random error into each trial. This randomness is simulated by sampling values from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of sigma.
