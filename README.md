Welcome! This website will form the basis of the 2024 ManyBabies workshop on Data Simulation & Power Analysis. Before we start, I would like to emphasise that this workshop has been a collaborative effort and has had input from many different people. 

First of all, the approach and code were born out of a series of meetings with researchers on the data analysis team in the ManyBabies5 project (https://manybabies.org/MB5/). This was a fundamentally exploratory project, the exploration being guided only by curiosity and a what-if mindset.

For example, how do predictors with two or three levels impact the power to detect an effect on infant looking times? How does variability in individual labs come to affect generalisability and statistical power? What is the optimal balance between various pracical constraints (e.g., an upper bound on the number of stimulus items that infants can attend to) and statistical inference (e.g., how much of a decrease in power are we willing to accept based on the above constraints)? Can these results inform the experimental design in some way and allow us to improve chances of replicability?

This workshop assumes a little literacy in R and linear mixed-effects models, but I have attempted to make these subjects as accessible as possible, even without knowledge of these topics. If you are interested in gaining hands-on pracical experience with the code, then feel free to follow this guide on installing and using R: https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html.

If you do have R and RStudio set up on your laptop, feel free to download the following .Rmd files with the code, so that you can get a better idea of what each code snippet does and can manipulate them according to your own needs.

I hope that this will be fun experience and useful exploration of data simulation, power analysis, statistical modelling and programming, and if you have any questions, big or small, feel free to contact me on chris[dot]mm[dot]cox@gmail.com.
